# Mad Libs Generator
> Fun Mad Libs Generator using Python

Manipulate user-inputted data as the Mad Libs reference. The input from the user can be anything from an adjective, a pronoun, or even a verb. All the inputs are entered the application takes all the data and arranges it to build a story template.

## How it works:
One player asks the other players for a word to fill in the blank without giving any context or the word. The script fills out the template, and submits a printout of the story. Reader commences laughter. ;)

 - An **adverb** describes a verb (often ending in -ly). Examples: *fast, very, slowly*
